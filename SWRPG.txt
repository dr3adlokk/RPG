Full Sith Code: 
Peace is a lie
There is only passion
Through passion I gain strength
Through strength I gain power
Through power I gain victory
Through victory my chains are broken
The Force shall set me free.

There is no fear, There is power.
There is no death, There is immortality.
There is no weakness, There is the Dark Side.
There is no Guidance, There is Control.
There is no Unity, There is Strength.
There is no End, There is Eternity.
There is no Defeat, There is Glory.
